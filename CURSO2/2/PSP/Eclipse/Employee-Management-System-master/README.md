# Employee-Management-System
This a basic java project made using Java Swings (without drag and drop). User should login then he can add, remove, view employee or he/she can update employee details. 
There is also an option where user can change login password using a unique string KeyID(which should be updated every time a password is changed).
P.S. I took help from a youtube video by @Code For Interview for background images and placement of different widgets/Labels i.e. thier coordinates. 
Databases- login and employee_details

Column names for login database:   username password keyid
Column names for employee_details:  EmployeeID Name FatherName Age DOB Address Phone EmailID Education JobPost AadharNo
